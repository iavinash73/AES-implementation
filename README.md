## Introduction

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe. This implementation is designed to provide a clear understanding of how AES works by coding it from the ground up. 

- Full implementation of AES encryption and decryption.
- Step-by-step explanation of the algorithm.
- Example usage within the notebook.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`
